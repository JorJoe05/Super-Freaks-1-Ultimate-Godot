SUPER FREAKS 1 ULTIMATE EDITION

GAMEPLAY
	Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition is a 2D platformer. The game can be played in single player, or two-player co-op.
	In every level, you'll need to get to the end and/or fight a boss.
	The players share hearts--they begin each level with 0, but can find more. 
	When hit without a heart, a player will die, and in co-op will be placed in a bubble.
	If all players die or are in a bubble at once, they will respawn at the beginning of the level or the nearest checkpoint.
